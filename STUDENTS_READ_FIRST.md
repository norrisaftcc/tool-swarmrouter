# 🐝 SwarmRouter: Student Guide - READ THIS FIRST!

Welcome to SwarmRouter! This guide will help you understand what this project is, how it works, and how you can contribute.

## 🤔 What is SwarmRouter?

SwarmRouter demonstrates **swarm intelligence for AI** - instead of using one big expensive AI model, we coordinate multiple smaller, cheaper models to work together like a bee hive. This saves **70%+ on AI costs** while maintaining quality!

Think of it like this:
- **Old way**: One expert does everything (expensive, slow)
- **SwarmRouter way**: A team of specialists work together (cheaper, faster)

## 🔌 What is MCP and Why Do We Use It?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a new technology created by Anthropic that lets AI applications talk to each other in a standardized way.

### Why MCP is Important:
- **Standardized Communication**: Like HTTP for web, MCP is becoming the standard for AI tools
- **Tool Sharing**: Different AI apps can share the same tools and resources
- **Future-Proof**: Learning MCP now prepares you for the AI ecosystem
- **Real Industry Use**: Companies are adopting MCP for production AI systems

### Think of MCP Like This:
```
┌─────────────┐    MCP Protocol    ┌─────────────┐
│   Claude    │ ←──────────────→   │ SwarmRouter │
│   Desktop   │                    │   Server    │
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘
     ↑                                     ↑
    User                            Coordinates AI
                                       Swarm
```

## 🚀 Two Ways to Connect: stdio vs HTTP Streaming

MCP supports two connection methods:

### 1. **stdio (Standard Input/Output)**
```bash
# Simple, direct connection
mcp dev src/server.py
```
- **Best for**: Development and testing
- **How it works**: Direct process communication
- **Pros**: Simple, fast setup
- **Cons**: Single connection only

### 2. **HTTP Streaming** 
```bash
# Network-based connection with WebSockets
uvicorn src.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
- **Best for**: Production and multiple users
- **How it works**: Web server with real-time streaming
- **Pros**: Multiple connections, web-based, scalable
- **Cons**: More complex setup

**For this project**, we use **stdio** for simplicity, but the code is designed to support both!

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Start the Program

### Option 1: One-Command Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd swarmrouter-mcp
./start.sh
```

This automatically:
- ✅ Creates a virtual environment
- ✅ Installs all dependencies  
- ✅ Runs tests to verify everything works
- ✅ Shows you all available commands

### Option 2: See the Magic in Action
```bash
./start.sh queen-bee
```

This runs a **live demo** showing:
- Sonnet (queen bee) analyzing complex tasks
- Multiple Haiku instances (worker bees) executing subtasks
- **Real 70%+ token savings** with actual API calls!

### Option 3: Start the MCP Server
```bash
./start.sh server
```

This starts the MCP server that other AI applications can connect to.

### The Bee Metaphor Explained

Real bees use different dances to communicate - we do the same with AI tasks:

| Dance Type | Real Bees | Our AI System | Token Savings |
|------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 🕺 **Waggle** | "Complex food source far away" | Complex task decomposition | 70%+ |
| ⭕ **Round** | "Simple food source nearby" | Simple notifications | 10-20% |
| 🔍 **Scout** | "Exploring new areas" | Research and investigation | 50% |
| 🚨 **Tremble** | "Need more help!" | Error handling | 30% |
| 🤝 **Converge** | "Let's decide together" | Team consensus building | 60% |
| 📊 **Disperse** | "Spread out and work" | Parallel task execution | 75% |

### How Task Delegation Works

1. **Task Arrives**: "Build a user authentication system"
2. **Queen Bee Analysis**: Sonnet analyzes complexity → "This is complex" → Waggle dance
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break into subtasks:
   - Design database schema
   - Create API endpoints  
   - Build frontend components
   - Write tests
4. **Worker Bee Assignment**: Multiple Haiku instances get subtasks
5. **Parallel Execution**: All worker bees work simultaneously
6. **Result Compilation**: Combine results into final solution
7. **Token Savings**: Used 1,833 tokens instead of 6,415 → **71% savings!**
