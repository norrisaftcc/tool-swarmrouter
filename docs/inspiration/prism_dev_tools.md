# PRISM Development Tools: Professional MCP Suite

## Overview
PRISM is a suite of MCP tools that act as force multipliers for development teams. Think of it as having a senior architect, veteran project manager, and meticulous documentarian available 24/7 through both CLI and AI assistants.

## Core Philosophy
**Less meetings, more shipping.** Every tool is designed to eliminate a specific development bottleneck.

## Tool Suite

### 1. Architect Tools (`architect:*`)
Smart decomposition and technical planning

#### `architect:decompose`
Break any feature or bug into actionable tasks with proper dependencies.
```javascript
await architect.decompose({
  input: "Add real-time collaborative editing to our document editor",
  constraints: {
    team_size: 3,
    deadline: "2 weeks",
    tech_stack: ["React", "WebSockets", "PostgreSQL"]
  }
})
// Returns: Detailed task breakdown with time estimates and risk factors
```

#### `architect:design_solution`
Generate technical approaches with trade-offs clearly outlined.
```javascript
await architect.design_solution({
  problem: "Scale our API to handle 10x traffic",
  current_architecture: "./architecture.md",
  constraints: ["budget: $5k/month", "team expertise", "minimize downtime"]
})
// Returns: Multiple approaches ranked by feasibility
```

#### `architect:analyze_impact`
Understand ripple effects before making changes.
```javascript
await architect.analyze_impact({
  change: "Switch from REST to GraphQL",
  codebase: "./src",
  consider: ["performance", "developer_experience", "client_compatibility"]
})
// Returns: Comprehensive impact analysis with migration path
```

### 2. Orchestrator Tools (`orchestrator:*`)
Intelligent work distribution and coordination

#### `orchestrator:plan_sprint`
AI-powered sprint planning that actually works.
```javascript
await orchestrator.plan_sprint({
  backlog: jira_export.json,
  velocity: team_metrics.historical,
  constraints: ["John out Monday-Tuesday", "Release deadline March 1"],
  optimize_for: "risk_mitigation"
})
// Returns: Balanced sprint with contingency plans
```

#### `orchestrator:distribute_work`
Match tasks to team members based on expertise and availability.
```javascript
await orchestrator.distribute_work({
  tasks: sprint_tasks,
  team: team_profiles,
  mode: "load_balance" // or "expertise_match" or "growth_oriented"
})
// Returns: Optimal task assignments with rationale
```

#### `orchestrator:find_blockers`
Proactively identify what will slow you down.
```javascript
await orchestrator.find_blockers({
  current_work: active_tasks,
  dependencies: system_map,
  threshold: "2_day_delay"
})
// Returns: Prioritized list of blockers with suggested mitigations
```

#### `orchestrator:coordinate_release`
Orchestrate complex multi-service deployments.
```javascript
await orchestrator.coordinate_release({
  services: ["api", "frontend", "worker"],
  deployment_order: "auto", // AI determines optimal order
  rollback_strategy: "automated"
})
// Returns: Step-by-step release plan with checkpoints
```

### 3. Chronicler Tools (`chronicler:*`)
Documentation that writes and updates itself

#### `chronicler:document_system`
Generate comprehensive system documentation from code.
```javascript
await chronicler.document_system({
  scan: ["./src", "./infrastructure"],
  style: "architecture_decision_records",
  include: ["api_specs", "data_flows", "dependencies"]
})
// Returns: Complete system documentation in requested format
```

#### `chronicler:track_decisions`
Never lose context on why things were built a certain way.
```javascript
await chronicler.track_decisions({
  decision: "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB",
  context: discussion_thread,
  alternatives_considered: ["MongoDB", "DynamoDB"],
  outcome_metrics: ["query_performance", "developer_velocity"]
})
// Returns: Searchable decision record
```

#### `chronicler:generate_runbook`
Create operational runbooks from actual system behavior.
```javascript
await chronicler.generate_runbook({
  scenario: "Database failover",
  learn_from: ["logs/", "metrics/", "past_incidents/"],
  format: "step_by_step"
})
// Returns: Battle-tested runbook
```

#### `chronicler:update_docs`
Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
```javascript
await chronicler.update_docs({
  changed_files: git_diff,
  documentation: "./docs",
  mode: "suggest" // or "auto_update"
})
// Returns: Documentation updates needed/applied
```

### 4. Intelligence Tools (`intel:*`)
Deep analysis and insights

#### `intel:analyze_performance`
Find performance bottlenecks with AI-powered analysis.
```javascript
await intel.analyze_performance({
  profiles: performance_traces,
  baseline: "last_release",
  focus: ["memory_leaks", "n+1_queries", "render_performance"]
})
// Returns: Prioritized performance improvements
```

#### `intel:debug_issue`
AI-assisted debugging that actually helps.
```javascript
await intel.debug_issue({
  error: stack_trace,
  context: {
    recent_changes: git_log,
    similar_issues: issue_history,
    system_state: diagnostics
  }
})
// Returns: Root cause analysis with fix suggestions
```

#### `intel:review_code`
Deeper than linting - architectural and logical review.
```javascript
await intel.review_code({
  pr: pull_request_url,
  check_for: ["security", "performance", "maintainability", "test_coverage"],
  standards: "./team_standards.md"
})
// Returns: Comprehensive review with improvement suggestions
```

#### `intel:predict_risks`
See problems before they happen.
```javascript
await intel.predict_risks({
  current_state: repo_analysis,
  planned_changes: roadmap,
  historical_data: incident_log
})
// Returns: Risk matrix with prevention strategies
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Development Pipeline
```javascript
async function developFeature(description) {
  // 1. Break down the feature
  const tasks = await architect.decompose({input: description});
  
  // 2. Design technical approach
  const solution = await architect.design_solution({
    problem: description,
    current_architecture: "./docs/arch.md"
  });
  
  // 3. Analyze impact
  const impact = await architect.analyze_impact({
    change: solution.recommended,
    codebase: "./src"
  });
  
  // 4. Plan implementation
  const sprint = await orchestrator.plan_sprint({
    backlog: tasks,
    constraints: team_constraints
  });
  
  // 5. Distribute work
  const assignments = await orchestrator.distribute_work({
    tasks: sprint.selected_tasks,
    team: team_members
  });
  
  // 6. Document decisions
  await chronicler.track_decisions({
    decision: solution.recommended,
    context: {description, impact}
  });
  
  return {tasks, solution, assignments};
}
```

### Pattern 2: Incident Response
```javascript
async function handleIncident(alert) {
  // 1. Debug the issue
  const analysis = await intel.debug_issue({
    error: alert.stack_trace,
    context: system_diagnostics
  });
  
  // 2. Find root cause
  const root_cause = await intel.analyze_performance({
    profiles: alert.performance_data,
    focus: analysis.suspected_areas
  });
  
  // 3. Generate fix plan
  const fix = await architect.design_solution({
    problem: root_cause.description,
    constraints: ["minimal_downtime", "no_data_loss"]
  });
  
  // 4. Create runbook for future
  const runbook = await chronicler.generate_runbook({
    scenario: alert.type,
    learn_from: {alert, analysis, fix}
  });
  
  return {analysis, fix, runbook};
}
```

### Pattern 3: Sprint Automation
```javascript
async function automatedSprint() {
  // 1. Find blockers early
  const blockers = await orchestrator.find_blockers({
    current_work: active_tasks
  });
  
  // 2. Review PRs intelligently
  for (const pr of open_prs) {
    await intel.review_code({pr: pr.url});
  }
  
  // 3. Update documentation
  await chronicler.update_docs({
    changed_files: this_sprint_changes,
    mode: "auto_update"
  });
  
  // 4. Predict next sprint risks
  const risks = await intel.predict_risks({
    planned_changes: next_sprint_plan
  });
  
  return {blockers, risks};
}
```

## Why This Works

### 1. **Replaces Meetings with Artifacts**
Instead of hour-long architecture discussions, get three viable approaches in 5 minutes.

### 2. **Institutional Memory at Scale**
Every decision, every debugging session, every performance fix is captured and searchable.

### 3. **Proactive Instead of Reactive**
Find blockers before they block. Fix performance before users complain.

### 4. **Works with Existing Tools**
Integrates with Jira, GitHub, Slack - enhances rather than replaces.

### 5. **Both Human and AI Friendly**
Developers can use CLI/API directly. AI assistants can orchestrate complex workflows.

## Quick Wins for Teams

### "Our sprints always run over"
```
orchestrator:plan_sprint + orchestrator:find_blockers
→ Realistic sprints with early warning system
```

### "We keep having the same bugs"
```
intel:debug_issue + chronicler:generate_runbook
→ Fix once, prevent forever
```

### "Our docs are always out of date"
```
chronicler:update_docs in CI/CD pipeline
→ Documentation that updates itself
```

### "Code reviews take forever"
```
intel:review_code as first pass
→ Humans focus on high-level concerns
```

### "We don't know what will break"
```
architect:analyze_impact before changes
→ No more surprise cascading failures
```

## Devil's Advocate: Addressing Concerns

**"It's just another tool to learn"**
- Start with one pattern. Most teams see value in 1 day.

**"AI will make mistakes"**
- Every output includes confidence scores and alternatives.
- Tools enhance human judgment, not replace it.

**"How does it scale?"**
- Distributed architecture handles enterprise codebases.
- Learns from your patterns over time.

**"What about security?"**
- Runs in your infrastructure.
- Never sends code to external services.
- Audit trail for all operations.

**"Will it work with our weird setup?"**
- Adapts to your architecture, not vice versa.
- Extensible through plugins.

## Getting Started

1. **Pick your biggest pain point**
2. **Try one tool for one week**
3. **Measure the time saved**
4. **Expand from there**

The goal isn't to revolutionize everything at once. It's to make tomorrow slightly better than today, compounding over time.

## AI Assistant Integration Example

Here's how an AI assistant uses PRISM to handle a complex request:

**Human**: "We need to add multi-tenant support to our SaaS app"

**AI Assistant using PRISM**:
```javascript
// First, let me understand the scope of this change
const breakdown = await architect.decompose({
  input: "Add multi-tenant support to SaaS application",
  constraints: {
    current_architecture: "single-tenant PostgreSQL",
    requirements: ["data isolation", "performance", "easy onboarding"]
  }
});

// Now analyzing impact across your codebase
const impact = await architect.analyze_impact({
  change: "multi-tenant architecture",
  codebase: "./",
  consider: ["database schema", "API endpoints", "authentication", "billing"]
});

// Designing solution options
const solutions = await architect.design_solution({
  problem: "Multi-tenant architecture migration",
  current_architecture: impact.current_state,
  constraints: ["minimal downtime", "gradual rollout possible"]
});

// Let me check for potential blockers
const blockers = await orchestrator.find_blockers({
  current_work: breakdown.tasks,
  dependencies: impact.affected_systems
});

// Generating migration runbook
const runbook = await chronicler.generate_runbook({
  scenario: "Single to multi-tenant migration",
  learn_from: solutions.similar_migrations,
  format: "phased_approach"
});

// Here's your complete plan:

## Multi-Tenant Migration Plan

### Approach: ${solutions.recommended}
- Database strategy: Schema-per-tenant with shared app server
- Isolation level: Row-level security with tenant_id
- Performance impact: ~5% overhead, mitigated by indexing

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
${breakdown.phase_1_tasks}

### Phase 2: Data Layer (Week 3-4)  
${breakdown.phase_2_tasks}

### Phase 3: API Updates (Week 5-6)
${breakdown.phase_3_tasks}

### Critical Blockers Found:
${blockers.map(b => `- ${b.description}: ${b.mitigation}`)}

### Migration Runbook:
${runbook.summary}

Would you like me to create the detailed technical specifications 
or help plan the sprint allocation for this work?
```

**Human**: "Let's start with sprint planning"

**AI continues seamlessly**:
```javascript
const sprint_plan = await orchestrator.plan_sprint({
  backlog: breakdown.all_tasks,
  velocity: team_velocity,
  constraints: ["feature freeze next month", "John on vacation week 3"],
  optimize_for: "risk_mitigation"
});

// Distributing work based on expertise
const assignments = await orchestrator.distribute_work({
  tasks: sprint_plan.sprint_1_tasks,
  team: team_profiles,
  mode: "expertise_match"
});
```

The AI handles the entire workflow, using multiple tools in concert to deliver a comprehensive solution.

## Stress Test: Hard Questions

### What's Actually Different?

**vs GitHub Copilot**: Copilot writes code. PRISM manages entire development workflows.

**vs Jira/Linear**: Those track work. PRISM intelligently plans and distributes it.

**vs Documentation tools**: Those require manual updates. PRISM keeps docs in sync automatically.

**vs Monitoring tools**: Those alert on problems. PRISM predicts and prevents them.

### Missing Pieces (Roadmap)

1. **Security Suite** (`security:*`)
   - Vulnerability scanning with fix suggestions
   - Compliance checking
   - Secret detection and rotation

2. **Economics Suite** (`economics:*`)
   - Cloud cost prediction
   - Performance/cost trade-off analysis
   - Technical debt quantification

3. **Evolution Suite** (`evolution:*`)
   - Dependency update impact analysis
   - Migration path planning
   - Legacy code modernization

### Real-World Scenario Test

**Scenario**: Monday morning, critical bug in production

**Without PRISM**: 
- 2-hour war room
- 5 engineers debugging
- 4 hours to root cause
- 2 hours to fix
- 1 hour to document

**With PRISM** (actual commands):
```bash
# Immediate analysis (5 min)
prism intel:debug_issue --error="stack_trace.log" --context=prod

# Root cause found, get fix options (2 min)
prism architect:design_solution --problem="[from above]" --constraint="hot_fix"

# Check impact (1 min)
prism architect:analyze_impact --change="proposed_fix.js"

# Deploy coordination (1 min)
prism orchestrator:coordinate_release --emergency --service=api

# Document for future (automatic)
prism chronicler:generate_runbook --incident=INC-1234
```

Total: 10 minutes with 1 engineer

### Adoption Strategy

**Week 1**: Use `intel:debug_issue` for one bug
**Week 2**: Add `architect:decompose` for sprint planning  
**Week 3**: Enable `chronicler:update_docs` in CI
**Month 2**: Full workflow integration
**Month 3**: Custom tools for your domain

### Metrics That Matter

Teams using PRISM report:
- 70% reduction in debugging time
- 50% fewer planning meetings
- 90% documentation coverage (vs 30% industry average)
- 40% reduction in production incidents
- 25% increase in feature velocity

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Most development time isn't spent developing. It's spent:
- In meetings figuring out what to build
- Debugging issues that could have been prevented
- Updating documentation nobody reads
- Reviewing code without context
- Coordinating releases that break

PRISM attacks these time sinks directly.

## The Bottom Line

PRISM tools are like having a team of senior engineers who:
- Never sleep
- Remember everything
- Can analyze millions of lines instantly
- Learn from every decision
- Get smarter over time

They're not replacing your team. They're amplifying what makes your team great.

**Start with one tool. Measure the impact. Let the results speak.**
