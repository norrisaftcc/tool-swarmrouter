**Scout + Artifacts** → Code Generator with Best Practices
```python
# Workflow for creating teaching examples:
1. resolve_library_id("fastapi")  # Get latest docs
2. get_library_docs(topic="authentication")  # Current patterns
3. artifacts.create(  # Generate teaching example
    type="application/vnd.ant.code",
    content=authenticated_api_example

async function validateStudentCode(submissionPath) {
    const code = await window.fs.readFile(submissionPath);
    const testResults = runEducationalTests(code, {
        checkStyle: true,
        checkCorrectness: true,
        provideFeedback: true
    });
    return generateLearningReport(testResults);
}
```

### Debugging Phase

**Taskmaster AI** → Intelligent Debugging Assistant
- `adaptive_task_routing` → Route errors to appropriate solution paths
- `monitor_workflow_health` → Detect when students are stuck

**Sequential Thinking** → Debugging Pedagogy
```python
# Transform errors into learning opportunities
debug_lesson = create_reasoning_chain(
    problem="TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined",
    domain="JavaScript debugging",
    reasoning_style="inductive"
)
# Generates Socratic questions leading to understanding
```

## Integrated Workflows

### Workflow 1: Sprint Zero (Course Preparation)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Market Research] --> B[Learning Objectives]
    B --> C[Epic Creation]
    C --> D[Story Mapping]
    D --> E[Sprint Planning]
    E --> F[Resource Allocation]
```

**Implementation**:
1. **Market Research**: `web_search("junior developer skills 2025")` + `google_drive_search("industry advisory board feedback")`
2. **Learning Objectives**: `decompose_learning_query` each major skill into components
3. **Epic Creation**: `ai_assisted_planning` to generate project themes
4. **Story Mapping**: `orchestrate_educational_workflow` to sequence topics
5. **Sprint Planning**: `plan_meshnet_workflow` for 2-week cycles
6. **Resource Allocation**: `coordinate_meshnet_task` across teaching team

### Workflow 2: Rapid Project Development

```python
async function createCourseProject(concept, difficulty) {
    // 1. Ideation
    const ideas = await ai_assisted_planning({
        objective: `Create ${concept} project for ${difficulty} students`,
        constraints: ["2-week timeline", "teaches 3+ concepts", "industry-relevant"]
    });
    
    // 2. Requirements
    const stories = await decompose_learning_query(ideas.best_option);
    
    // 3. Scaffolding
    const structure = await generateProjectStructure(stories);
    await filesystem.create_directory(structure);
    
    // 4. Development
    const docs = await scout.get_library_docs(concept);
    const code = await artifacts.create({
        type: "application/vnd.ant.code",
        content: generateTeachingCode(docs, stories)
    });
    
    // 5. Testing
    const tests = await createEducationalTests(code);
    
    // 6. Documentation
    await effect_docs.generate_living_docs({
        doc_type: "workflow",
        include_metrics: true
    });
    
    return { project: code, tests, documentation };
}
```

### Workflow 3: Continuous Improvement Pipeline

**Pre-Semester**:
1. Analyze previous semester with `track_thinking_process`
2. Update materials using `adaptive_task_routing` based on pain points
3. Generate new examples with current tool versions via `scout`

**During Semester**:
1. `monitor_workflow_health` on student progress
2. `discover_synergies` between struggling concepts
3. `document_progress` for real-time curriculum adjustment

**Post-Semester**:
1. Comprehensive retrospective with all tracking data
2. Auto-generate improvement recommendations
3. Update living documentation for next instructor

## Agile Ceremonies via MCP

### Daily Standup (with TAs)
```python
# Automated standup generator
coordination_status = coordinate_meshnet_task({
    task_description: "Daily teaching team sync",
    required_capabilities: ["progress_tracking", "blocker_identification"],
    parallelization: True
})
```

### Sprint Planning
Use `plan_meshnet_workflow` with teaching objectives as "features" and class sessions as "sprints"

### Retrospectives
Combine `track_thinking_process` results with student feedback for data-driven improvements

## Remember

You're not just using tools; you're building a teaching machine that:
- Reduces preparation time from weeks to days
- Ensures consistency across sections
- Adapts based on student performance
- Creates reusable, improving assets
- Models professional development practices

The secret is seeing each tool as a phase in your development pipeline, not just a utility. When students see you using the same agile practices you're teaching, the lessons become authentic and powerful.
