- [ ] **Plan your tests**: How will you verify it works?
- [ ] **Ask AI for suggestions**: "@ai what's the best way to implement this?"

### Step 3: Implement and Test
- [ ] **Start small**: Get basic functionality working first
- [ ] **Test frequently**: Check your changes work as you go
- [ ] **Use AI help**: Get suggestions for improvements
- [ ] **Add error handling**: Make sure edge cases are covered

### Step 4: Review and Polish
- [ ] **Self-review**: Read through your changes
- [ ] **AI review**: Ask AI to check for issues
- [ ] **Format code**: Run code formatting tools
- [ ] **Update documentation**: Add comments and update docs

## Technical Details (Fill in what you know)

### Files That Might Need Changes
- **Main file**: `src/[component]/[file].py` (if you know it)
- **Test file**: `tests/test_[component].py` (create if needed)
- **Documentation**: `docs/[relevant-doc].md` (if applicable)
- **Configuration**: Any config files that need updates

### Key Functions/Classes Involved
- **Function to modify**: `function_name()` (if you know it)
- **New function to create**: Describe what it should do
- **Classes involved**: List relevant classes
- **APIs/endpoints**: Any web endpoints affected

### External Dependencies
- **New libraries needed**: List any new dependencies
- **API calls**: External services this might use
- **Database changes**: Any data structure changes
- **Environment variables**: New configuration needed

## Testing Plan (Keep It Simple)

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Happy path**: Test the main functionality works
- [ ] **Error cases**: Test what happens when things go wrong
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Test unusual but possible scenarios
- [ ] **User experience**: Make sure it's easy to use

### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Test individual functions work correctly
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Test components work together
- [ ] **AI-generated tests**: Ask AI to suggest test cases
- [ ] **Existing tests pass**: Make sure you didn't break anything

### Test Examples
```python
# Example test structure (AI can help fill this in)
def test_new_feature():
    # Arrange - set up test data
    # Act - call the function being tested
    # Assert - check the result is correct
    pass
```

## Getting Help
