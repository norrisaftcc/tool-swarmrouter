## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Week 1-2 (Sprint 1)
- **Risk**: MCP protocol complexity
- **Mitigation**: Dedicate time to study Anthropic examples

### Week 3-4 (Sprint 2)
- **Risk**: Authentication vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Security review before Sprint 3

### Week 5-6 (Sprint 3)
- **Risk**: Tool integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Integration tests from Sprint 3

### Week 7-8 (Sprint 4)
- **Risk**: Performance at scale
- **Mitigation**: Load testing begins

## Notes for Product Owner

1. **Prioritization**: Focus on tools that unblock the most developers first
2. **Feedback Loops**: Weekly demos to gather early feedback
3. **Scope Management**: MVP focus on dev tools only (not full swarm/observatory)
4. **Quality Gates**: Each tool must be production-ready before moving to next

This roadmap follows Agile best practices while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on team velocity and stakeholder feedback.
