# Multi-Agent/LLM-Driven GitHub Workflow

## Overview

This guide establishes a comprehensive, best-practices-driven workflow for multi-agent and LLM-powered development in the SwarmRouter ecosystem. It leverages the power of AI assistants, automated tooling, and systematic decomposition to enable efficient, collaborative development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent-Assisted Development
- **AI-First Planning**: Use LLM agents to analyze requirements, decompose tasks, and suggest implementation approaches
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Combine human expertise with AI assistance for optimal decision-making
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents learn from codebase patterns and previous decisions

### 2. Systematic Decomposition
- **Epic → Story → Task**: Break down complex features into manageable components
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and document inter-task dependencies
- **Parallel Development**: Enable multiple developers to work on different components simultaneously

### 3. Quality-First Approach
- **Prevention over Detection**: Use AI to catch issues before they reach production
- **Automated Validation**: Implement comprehensive CI/CD with AI-enhanced testing
- **Living Documentation**: Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

```

## Phase 1: Epic Planning & Decomposition

### 1.1 Epic Creation
Create high-level features using the following template:

```markdown
**Epic**: [HIVE-EPIC-X] Feature Name
**Business Value**: Clear statement of user/system benefit
**Technical Scope**: High-level technical components involved
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Measurable outcomes
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] Integration requirements
**Estimated Effort**: T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)
**Dependencies**: List of blocking requirements
```

### 1.2 AI-Assisted Analysis
Use LLM agents to analyze epics:

```bash
# Example: Using Claude or similar LLM for epic analysis
@claude analyze epic: "[HIVE-EPIC-X] Feature Name"
- Identify technical risks
- Suggest decomposition strategy
- Recommend implementation approach
- Estimate complexity and dependencies
```

### 1.3 Story Decomposition
Break epics into user stories with clear boundaries:

```markdown
**Story**: [HIVE-X.Y] Specific User Story
**As a** [user type]
**I want** [functionality]
**So that** [business value]

**Technical Details**:
- API endpoints required
- Data models involved
- Integration points
- Performance requirements

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests written (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] AI code review passed
- [ ] Manual testing completed
```

## Phase 2: Issue Management & Branching

### 2.1 Issue Template Usage
Create issues using the standardized template (see `docs/issue_template.md`):

```markdown
**Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Component**: [API/Frontend/Database/Infrastructure]
**Sprint**: Target sprint number
**Assignee**: Developer or AI agent identifier
**Related Issues**: Links to dependencies
**AI Assistance Level**: [Full/Partial/Manual]
```

### 2.2 Branching Strategy
Implement feature-branch workflow with AI integration:

```bash
# Branch naming convention
feature/hive-{epic-number}-{story-number}-{brief-description}
bugfix/issue-{number}-{brief-description}
ai-enhancement/{component}-{improvement-type}

# Example branches
feature/hive-1-2-user-authentication
bugfix/issue-45-api-timeout
ai-enhancement/core-performance-optimization
```

### 2.3 Multi-Agent Coordination
Assign different aspects to specialized agents:

- **Architect Agent**: System design and technical planning
- **Code Agent**: Implementation and refactoring
- **Test Agent**: Test strategy and automation
